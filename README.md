## General Information
- This project addresses the problem of diagnosing melanoma from dermoscopic images using CNNs.
- The goal is to automate and assist dermatologists in identifying melanoma, which could improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses.
- The dataset used is from the **Skin Cancer ISIC (The International Skin Imaging Collaboration)**, divided into training and test sets. It contains images of various skin lesions classified into nine categories, including melanoma.

## Conclusions
- Data augmentation significantly reduced overfitting and improved the model's generalization.
- The model achieved high accuracy in detecting melanoma after balancing the class distribution.
- The alert system effectively flagged images with melanoma, making it a useful tool for dermatologists.
- Further improvements can be made using advanced architectures like ResNet or VGG.
